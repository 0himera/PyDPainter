Create easy galaxy arms / branchs.
1. Customise a range of color (ie: violet to pink to white).
2. Stacks filled circles, from largest to smallest in the center, from darker to lighter using that color range (use keys [ ] )
3. Use Symmetry tool : Cyclic, order 3. Place it in the center of your galaxy.
4. Draw some stars using one pixel and + brush in lighter colors.
5. Use Curve tool, with a medium brush, using Smear mode, draw your arms from the center to outside the last circle area. Repeat at different place. (My exemple is drawn in red Color mode, do the same in Smear Mode)
6. Add some ramdom stars.
Here you are !

You can use same technique to create awesome explosion, using a different color range and Line tool to smear.
